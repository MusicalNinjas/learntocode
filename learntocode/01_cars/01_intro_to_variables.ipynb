    "1. You made up new nouns (`variables`) called `car` and `topspeed` and tell the computer what they are:\n",
    "    - `car` is a `str`ing of letters (Non-coders would call this \"some words\") - so `\"Bugatti Chiron\"`needs to go in quotes - like when someone is saying things in a book.\n",
    "      > (*Fun tip* - try getting rid of the `\"` quotes and see what happens!!)\n",
    "    - `topspeed` is a number - so no need for quotes\n",
    "1. Then you told the computer what to do `print` them:\n",
    "    - because the computer needs to be *really* sure what it should `print` you put the information in `(`brackets`)` - like when you want to be really clear about things in maths"
